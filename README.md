# Django-urls

In this task, I did the following:

*   Created a new github repository and cloned it to my computer
*   Then I created a new virtual environment and installed Django in it
*   Started a Django project with the username __I4G001640TMY__
*   Ran all migrations and created a superuser using the `createsuperuser
*   Changed the URL path to the Django admin dashboard to zuri-admin in the \<project>\\urls.py folder.
The new URL path is:
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/zuri-admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/zuri-admin)
Then I finally staged and pushed the changes to a new branch on github
